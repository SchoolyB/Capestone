 ## Making pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `development`.
2. If you've added/removed dependencies please update the `README.md`.
3. When naming your branch please follow these guidelines:
  - Prefix all branch names with `client-side/` or `server-side/` depending on where the majority of your contributions will be written in.
  - Following the `/` add no more than 4 words separated by `-` explaining what is being worked on in the branch. Examples: `server-side/server-crash-bug-fix` `client-side/nav-menu-styling-change`.
   - If the branch has an associated issue add the issue number to the end of the branch name. Example: `client-side/nav-menu-styling-change-300`. If there is no associated issue one is not required.
4. When submitting your PR ask to merge it the `development` branch.
