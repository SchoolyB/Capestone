Georgia has been conquered by a lot of foreign nations ever since the early times, and all of them have forcibly and intentionally influence the country in many ways including the country’s religion. Though invaded by nations of different religions, majority of Georgia still practice Christianity.

Georgian Orthodox Christianity is the religion practiced by the majority of Georgians, at about 65% of the population comprising its practitioners. Though the Georgian Orthodox has great influence on majority of the country, other religions still continue to flourish and people still continue to practice them. Other religions include Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, and Armenian Orthodox. Islam is practiced by some Georgians and non-Georgians in areas of the South and Southwest and in Abkhazian. There is also a small number of Georgians who practice Catholicism.

In the early times, Christianity was wronged and ignored by the Georgians up until 326 A.D. Legend has it that Georgia was with the Mother of God when she went spreading the good news of Christ in the new lands. Georgia, then, was considered as the country’s patroness. In the 4th century, Christianity was finally established firmly in the country of Georgia. This is proven by its dominance despite the forced practice of their own religion by the Persian, Mongol, Ottoman, Turk, and Arab conquerors.

Georgia is a place full of Christian structure relics, and one of them is the so called Tunic of God. This relic is kept and reserved in the Mtskheta Cathedral (Mtskheta is the former capital of Georgia, before T’bilisi) which they say will always be the center of the Georgian spiritual life.
