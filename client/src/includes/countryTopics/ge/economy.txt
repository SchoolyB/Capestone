Georgia is a country with rich natural resources and fertile lands. In this light, agricultural products are the main factors of the growth and development of its economy. People grow wheat, tea, silkworm, barley, cotton, tobacco and grapes. Georgia is the country which invented wine, and everyone who grows grapes is involved in wine making. Wine can be considered their main product and as of now they grow 500 different varieties of grapes.

Hydroelectric energy is quite rich in Georgia so they also distribute it in its neighbouring countries.

They also do import stuff like food, cars, fuel, machinery and energy carriers. They have Russia, Turkey and the United States of America as their import partner countries.

Georgia experienced deep economic recession before that is why they have been trying to develop their land so as to attract foreign investors. In 1991, after gaining independence, the country suffered from an economic down fall which points to the conflict between Abkhazia and South Ossetia as the main reason. In 1996, most small and some large business were privatized. Businessmen tried to venture into different industries such as construction and food processing. However, with the help of different organizations throughout the world like the World Bank and International Fund of Agricultural Development, Georgia has been able to stand up and continue developing for the continuous growth of its economy.
