Georgia is located in the Caucasus region, bound by the Black Sea, Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Due to its strategic location (as it is found between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea), it has been a constant economic interest for many foreign countries since the early B.C. For many centuries, the country has experienced continuous wars and revolutions by civilizations of foreign lands both from the east and the west parts of the world.

Georgia has been dominated and invaded by the Greeks, Persians and Romans during the early times. The Arabs invaded the country as well in the 7th century. This proves the diverse culture of the country since it has quite a number of influences.

From the 11th to the 13th century, Georgia experienced its “Golden Age of cultural, political and military ascendancy,” following it is the invasion of the Mongols during the 14th century.

In 1921, Georgia was invaded by the Red Army and then became a part of the Soviet Union. Fifteen years after, they are considered as one of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union. However, they experienced extreme oppression under the leadership of Stalin. They have been repressed of their rights and freedom.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union, Georgia declared its independence in 1991. It became a member of the United Nations shortly a year after. A few years after, in 1995, the Georgian government made amendments in the constitution and held their presidential elections. From then on, Georgia has been exercising its freedom as a democratic country.
