Bahamas was a British colony for more than 250 years.

The governors of Bahamas were given local authority after 1729, however they were required to refer any important decision to the British Colonial Office and through this office, to the British Parliament.

Today Bahamas is a parliamentary democracy and belongs to the Commonwealth of Nations that were at one time governed by Great Britain.

The Head of State is Queen Elizabeth II, who is represented by a native born governor.
