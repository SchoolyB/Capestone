Cambodia is one country that has gone through a lot of different eras which in one way or another has contributed to the prevailing culture observed in this South East Asian country.

Festivals in Cambodia are very much on top of the Cambodian psyche. One such festival is the Bon Om Teuk or the boat racing festival. This water festival is the most widely participated as almost, if not all, cities and provinces send delegates to race in the Tonle Sap River. The festival lasts for three days which features a boat racing competition and dazzling fireworks. During this festival, everything else literally stops in Cambodia. TV coverage shows nothing but the festivities and workers get three days off from work. Another important festival on the Cambodian calendar is the Khmer New Year. The Khmer New Year is not as grand as the water festival as people tend to go back to their home provinces making Pnom Penh deserted for three days.

One common sight anywhere to be noticed in this country is the food bicycle vendors. People in bicycles just sell about any kind of food. Usually, corn, tubers, fruits, vegetables and junk foods are the common items to be found on these mobile peddlers.

One other thing that is sure to be noticed is the habit of squatting on the floor, a gesture typically found among Asians. Cambodians are seen folding the knees while chatting with friends, waiting on a porch or gate or just plain watching passers-by. It is said that doing this gesture has spiritual roots as it makes one feel closer to the earth.

The Chinese community also exerts a big influence on the lives of Cambodians now. Many businesses are owned by Chinese, who have made Cambodia their home and employ many Cambodians.

Tourists for sure will enjoy visiting Cambodia as people are generally warm to foreigners as a big chunk of the countryâ€™s economy relies on tourism.
