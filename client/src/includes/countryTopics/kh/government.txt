The Kingdom of Cambodia, as the name precludes, has a modified monarchial form of government as the trend of countries that has a surviving royal family has forgone the ways of an absolutist monarchy. Currently, Cambodia operates on a multi-party constitution monarchy system as it has a king for a head of state and a prime minister which runs the government. A king appoints the prime minister. The king however cannot appoint outright a prime minister as it has to be confirmed first by the National Assembly. The military holds the king as the Supreme Commander of the Cambodian army. The throne of Cambodia is unlike other monarchy where a next of kin is usually the heir apparent. In Cambodia, a throne council exists to make sure that the next king would be fit to rule. Being the eldest son of a reigning king does not mean he will be the next king if the throne council does not deem him fit to be Cambodiaâ€™s ruler.

The prime minister is quite a powerful figure too as he is given a free hand on who to appoint as ministers of the different ministries. Together with his appointed ministers, the prime minister and his appointed ministers comprise the executive branch of the Cambodian government. Another power of the prime minister is being the commander-in-chief of the army.

The legislative branch of Cambodia follows a parliamentary style which has two chambers, the National Assembly of Cambodia and the Senate. The National Assembly has a total of 123 seats which are gained via popular election.  The Senate of Cambodia consists only of 61 seats and by law should not exceed more than half of the National Assembly. Two seats are reserved for the appointees of the King while another two seats are voted upon by the National Assembly and the rest has to be elected universally.
