Looking at the famous Angkor Wat temple, one would think that Cambodia must have had a glorious history similar to the likes of Egypt or the Incas of Mesoamerica. Evidences say that Cambodia is among the first places in South East Asia to have been inhabited as early as 1,000 to 2,000 BC and the Khmers being the first inhabitants. The golden age of Cambodia was achieved around 802 AD when Jayavarman II ascended to power and erected the Angkor Wat temple. Khmer’s might was so overpowering during this time that it was able to expand its territories up to what is now called Central Vietnam. However, during the death of Jayavarman VII, the Khmers slowly declined and the neighboring Thai and Vietnamese kingdoms were proving to be more powerful forces. Finally, at around 1431, the Angkorian monarchy gave up the territory to its Thai attackers and fled south. From that moment on, the Kingdom of Cambodia alternates as a vassal between the mightier Thai and Vietnamese kingdoms with some short-lived intervals of independence in between.

In 1863, King Norodom opted for Cambodia to become a protectorate of France to ensure protection from the Thais and Vietnamese.  The French granted independence to all of its territories in the French Indochina region in around 1953 including Cambodia.

During the US-Vietnam War, the ruling monarch, Sihanouk, was viewed by the US as an ally of the communists. A US backed coup d’ etat ousted him forcing him to go to China. Meanwhile, in Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge took advantage of Sihanouk’s predicament and the Vietnam War, slowly made their move to gain power. In 1975, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge finally seized total control of Cambodia and even changing its name to Kampuchea. This lasted only until 1979 as Vietnam once again occupied Cambodia as they were threatened by Pol Pot’s border incursions. The Vietnamese forces withdrew in 1989 but Pol Pot was still very much leading the cause of the Khmer Rouge. His resistance continued to be a hindrance to ongoing peace talks with the new coalition government which reinstalled the King as head of state and adapted a constitutional monarchy form of government. In 1995, Pol Pot was put in house arrest by Ta Mok, the military chief of the Khmer Rouge. Three years later, Pol Pot died of heart attack.

Right now, King Sihamoni and Prime Minister Hun Sen are steering Cambodia to a period of rebuilding and reconstruction.
