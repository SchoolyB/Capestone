The Belizeans have truly a complex evolution. Even though, the Spanish were not able to lay a hand on Belize despite controlling most of South America during the height of their might, Catholicism still was able to penetrate the country. Not only were the Catholics successful in establishing a church in Belize, they even got a majority following with 49% of the population can sing Ave Maria. Catholics can be found throughout most of the country unlike other religions that are mostly in one or two districts only.

The religion of the Baymen, the first settlers of Belize is that of the Protestant Church which accounts for 27% of present-day Belizeans. The 27% already includes other Protestant sects like the Pentecostals, Anglicans, Seventh-day Adventists and Mennonites After the Protestants, at far third, the Baptists and Methodists both have an equal share of the pie with each having a 3.5% following.

Surprisingly, there is also a contingent of the Greek Orthodox Church operating out of Santa Elena.

Although there are other religions that proliferate in the country, their numbers would be no more than 1% of the population. Among the religions who are busy converting followers right now are the Hindus, Baha’Is, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Rastafarians and Muslims.  Mostly, all religions operate in Belize City except for the Mennonites and Pentocostals, who are mostly in the Districts of Cayo and Orange Walk. One other thing worthy of noting is that Muslims is common among some Kriols who got converted by Middle Eastern immigrants.

With so many religions in this country, it is obvious that religious freedom is in their constitution.
