The economy of Belize has been experiencing growth since 2006 ever since crude oil was discovered there. It was only in 2009 when the global economic meltdown rippled through Belize that the economy of this Caribbean nation staggered a bit.  If the economies of its trading partners like the USA and the UK did not buckled up in 2009, Belize’s momentum would have been stellar if not exceptional as they still managed to grow their economy at a rate of 1.5%.

The tourism industry of the Belize is the biggest foreign exchange earner. Entry points such as its airport, cruise ship ports and border points have shown a steadily increasing arrival of foreign visitors since 2004.  It’s Ambergris Caye and the famous Belize Barrier Reef have somewhat sparked interests among beach lovers and eco-tourists as Belize offer both attractions.

The country is famous also for its traditional produces of citrus fruits and derivatives, cane sugar, marine products and garments. As of 2007, Belize has been exporting crude oil at a rate of 2,260 barrels per day. In 2008, production has been increased to 3,511 barrels per day. As of now, oil proved reserves were estimated to be at 6.7 million.

Be as it may, the government of Belize is not out of the dark yet as it has still to pay over $1 billion and the trade receipts still show that they export more than they import.

As to world ranking in terms of Gross Domestic Product and per capita income, Belize ranks 118th overall making them sort of in the middle which pretty much connote that they are not doing too bad.
