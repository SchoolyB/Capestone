The government of BelIze adopts a system of a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy. Belize was actually founded by English and Scottish settlers which later on became part of the British Crown. The Monarch in question is no other than Queen Elizabeth II who acts as the head of state but only symbolically. The country got self-governance status only in 1981. As with any member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Queen Elizabeth has usually a representative with a title of Governor General. The Governor General as stipulated by law should be a citizen of Belize. The powers of a Governor General are mostly limited to being an advisor and observer on political matters. The Governor General is the one who appoints the Prime Minister to make it as it was officially sanctioned by the Queen. The head of the government of Belize is embodied in the person of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is usually the head of the winning political party. There are only two political parties in Belize, and whichever party wins the most seats in the House of Representatives, the leader of the party automatically becomes the Prime Minister. After being officially vested as Prime Minister, the cabinet members can then be filled up.

The legislative branch of Belize is a bicameral one. The 8-member Senate is not elected but rather nominated. Five of the Senators would be appointed by the Prime Minister. Another two will be nominated by the opposition party leader and one by the Governor General. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to a 5-year term.

The Judicial Branch of Belize is composed of a Supreme Court which is the final arbiter and one magistrate courts for each of the 6 districts of this Caribbean nation.  Belize has also what they call Family Courts which settle disputes with regards to child custody and maintenance, domestic violence and other matters pertaining to disputes between family members.
