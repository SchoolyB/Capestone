The Susu migrated from the north and began settling in the area that is now Guinea in the beginning of 900. Its civilization reached its height in the 13th century. The Susu makes up about 20% of Guinea’s population today. The Fulani Empire dominated the country of Guinea from 16th to 19th century. In 1849, the French claimed it as a protectorate. The country was first called Rivieres du Sud, the protectorate was rechristened French Guinea; in 1895, it became part of French West Africa.

The country of Guinea achieved independence on October 2, 1958, and became an independent state with Sekou Toure as the president. Under Toure, the country was the first true Marxist state in Africa. Diplomatic relations with France were suspended in 1965, with the Soviet Union replacing France as the country’s chief source of economic and technical assistance.

When the exploitation of bauxite deposits start in 1960, prosperity came into the country. Before the death of Toure in March 1984, he was reelected to a 7-year term in 1974 and again in 1981 after 26 years of presidency in the country. A week later, a military regime headed by Col. Lansana Conte took power.

In 1989, President Conte announced that Guinea would move to a multiparty democracy, and in 1991, voters approved a new constitution. The president’s Unity and Progress Party took almost 51% of the vote in the election of December 1993. In 2001, a government referendum was passed that eliminated presidential term limits, thus allowing Conte to run for a third term in 2003. Despite the trappings of multiparty rule, Conte has ruled the country with an iron fist. For 24 years, Conte ruled the country which was criticized as corrupt. Anti-government demonstrators took to streets in January and February 2007, demanding the president to step down. The president agreed after declaring martial law. He put Lansana Kouyate as prime minister. Kouyate was then replaced in May 2008 by Ahmed Tidiane Souare.
