Cuban culture is a mixture of colorful, interesting and different, often contrasting, factors and influences. Since 1959, the Cuban Revolutionary had also greatly affected the culture of Cuba, down to the most basic level of daily life. The most and instantly recognized throughout the world in the Cuban culture is the Cuban music. The roots of most Cuban musical forms lie in the cabildos, a form of social club among African slaves brought to the island. These slaves brought rhythms and ritual dances that were blended with Spanish guitars and melodies and then appropriated and developed throughout America. Dances such as salsa and the cha-cha-cha originated in Cuba. The conga-line dance was developed by slaves shackled together, while much of contemporary Cuban dance has important associations with Afro-Cuban Santeria religion. Today, the most popular music is Son, which developed in the hills of the Oriente.

Cuban literature began to develop its own style in the 19th century. During that time, the major works published in Cuba were of an abolitionist character such as the writer Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda and Cirilio Villaverde y de la Paz. The country’s most famous literary figure is Jose Marti, whose life, ideas and martyr’s death made him as a national hero.

Cuba’s policy on religion has changed much since 1959. Historically, Roman Catholicism has been the dominant religion in Cuba and it remains so, with around 40% of Cubans at least nominally Catholic and some 4% of the population are Protestants.
