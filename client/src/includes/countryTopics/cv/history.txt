The islands of Cape Verde were first settled by the Portuguese in 1462. They established their initial settlement on the island of Santiago called Ribeira Grande now modern day Cidade Velha. They also named the island group Cabo Verde (Cape Verde). During the 16th century the archipelago grew rich from the transatlantic trade of slaves from Africa. This attracted attacks from European privateers or pirates like the famous Sir Francis Drake who sacked Ribeira Grande in 1585. In 1770 the nearby town of Praia became the capital.

The islands suffered economic hardships with the loss of the slave trade. But the islands became an important commercial trading center because of its strategic location in the mid-Atlantic shipping lanes, ideal for re-supplying sea vessels.

Portugal changed the status of Cape Verde from colony to an overseas province in 1951 in order to discourage the population's yearning for independence. In 1956, Cape Verdeans led by Amilcar Cabral joined the Guineans in forming the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). By 1961, the PAIGC were already in open revolt against Portugal. Much of Portuguese Guinea was under control by the rebel in 1972 and Cape Verde was still under Portuguese control. Eventually Cape Verde got its independence on July 5, 1975. In 1980, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau parted ways. One party rule was abandoned in favor of a multi party system. Their constitution which took effect in 1980 was revised three times. The republic is currently one of the most stable democratic states in Africa
