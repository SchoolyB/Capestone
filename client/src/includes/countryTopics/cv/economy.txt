Cape Verde has a service-oriented economy in which commerce, transport and public service contributes at least 70% of its GDP. Although almost two thirds of the population is in the rural areas, agriculture and fishing accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Cape Verdeans from overseas remits an amount equal to 20% of the GDP. Light manufacturing accounts for the remainder.

The country receives very little rainfall and limited fresh water supply. Out of the ten main islands, only Brava, Fogo, Santiago and Santo Antao, could support a significant agricultural output. As a result 90% of its food supply is imported. There are also few natural resources but Cape Verde has mineral deposits of salt, limestone and pozzolana, which is a volcanic rock used in cement production.

Since the early 1990s the government has set in placed market-oriented economic policies. This includes inviting foreign investors and a privatization program. Its priorities are promotion of a market economy, development of tourism, transports, communications, fisheries, light manufacturing and energy facilities. In 2000, at least $407 million in foreign investments were poured or planned for tourism, infrastructure, fisheries, services and industrial sector.

Since the islands are located at the cross roads of the mid-Atlantic air and sea lanes, they have made significant improvements of their main harbors. All of the islands have port facilities and the major ones are located in Mindelo and Praia. The Porto Grande at Mindelo also has ship repair capabilities. An international airport was also opened in Boa Vista last December 2007.

The country has significant links with Portugal in all economic levels. Its currency is currently linked to the Euro and is a member of the World Trade Organization.
