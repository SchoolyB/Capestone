The country of Cyprus has been existent into the government-controlled two-thirds of the island and the Turkish Cypriot one-third. The country is governed under the constitution of 1960. At independence, the country’s constitution called for a government divided into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, headed by a president, with strong guarantees for the Turkish Cypriot community. The president of the Cyprus, which is also the head of state and the head of government, is popularly elected for a 5-year term. Members of the island’s other minorities, the Armenians, Maronites, and Roman Catholics, were given the option of joining one of the communities for voting purposes.

The president and vice president of the country were provided with executive power in all but communal matters by the constitution. The executives have the right of veto, separately or jointly, over certain laws or decisions of both the Council of Ministers and the House of Representatives, the legislative body.

Seven Greek Cypriots and three Turkish Cypriots compose the Council of Ministers, with the former appointed by the president and the latter by the vice president. One of the three key portfolios, defense, finance, and foreign affairs, was to be held by a Turkish Cypriots. Decisions of the council were to be taken by absolute majority.

The House of Representatives is designed to legislate for the republic in all matters except those expressly reserved to separate communal chambers. The constitution provided that 35 of its members should be Greek Cypriots and 15 Turkish Cypriots.
