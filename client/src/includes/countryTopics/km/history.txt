The Comoros officially known as the Union of the Comoros is an independent archipelago island country in the Indian Ocean. It is located at the north of the Mozambique Channel off Africa’s eastern coast between northwestern Madagascar and northeastern Mozambique. Countries close to Comoros are Seychelles to the northeast and Tanzania to the northwest. The country’s capital city is Moroni on Grande Comore. The country’s history dates all the way back to 1,500 years. Comoros has been occupied by different groups of people over time and was colonized by the French in the 19th century, and gained independence in 1975. A brief history of the country will be discussed below.

Early inhabitants to The Comoros
Citadel of Mutsamudu, built by Abdallah Ben Mohamed El Masseli between 1782 and 1790, SourceIt is believed that the first people to visit the Comoros islands were the Phoenician sailors. Bantu-speaking Africans were the earliest settlers of Comoros and evidence of their habitation on the islands is found from the 6th century. Traces of this culture have merged with sequential African, Malagasy, and Arab waves. Shirazi emigrants started to arrive in the country some time after the 10th century AD.

In the 16th century, a number of social changes took place on the East African coast. Most of these changes were possibly related to the Portuguese arrival. This led to the influx of numerous Hadrami Arabs who forged coalitions with the Shirazis and established some royal clans.

As the centuries went by, Comoros was occupied by a series of diverse communities from Madagascar, Southeast Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the African coast. Explorers from Portugal were the first to visit the archipelago in 1505.

The French Parmentier brothers visited the islands in 1529. Besides these two brothers, Portugal was the only other country that visited Comoros in the 16th century. It was in the 17th century when the Dutch and British started arriving in the country and the Ndzwani Island was soon made a key supply location on the eastern route. Ndzwani Island was governed by a Sultan who frequently tried to expand his power to the islands; Mwali and Mayotte. Ngazidja was disunited and was at some point divided into 12 kingdoms.

In the mid-19th century, both the French and the British shifted their attention to the islands of Comoros, each party wanting to conquer them. The islands were finally obtained by the French by use of the ‘divide and conquer’ policy and chequebook politics. The French retained control of the country and suppressed any unrest and sporadic uprisings.

European Contact and French Colonial Rule in The Comoros
As mentioned earlier, Portuguese were the first explorers to visit the islands which provided them with supplies for their fort at Mozambique during the 16th century.

In 1793, the islands were raided by Malagasy warriors from Madagascar who came looking for slaves. By 1865, it was believed that roughly 40% of the country’s population was made up of slaves. It was in 1841 when France established its colonial rule in the islands, after first arriving in Mayotte, and signing of the Treaty of April of 1841. This treaty yielded the island to France.

The Comoros was used as a way terminal for traders voyaging to India and the Far East. This happened until the Suez Canal was opened, which reduced by a huge percent the traffic passing via the Mozambique Channel. Comoros exported local goods such as tortoiseshells, cattle, and coconuts. Wealthy Arab traders, French settlers and companies owned by the French created a plantation-founded economic system that made use of a section of the land for export crops.

In 1886, the Sultan of Bambao, Said Ali bin Said Omar, ratified a treaty with the French government, allowing France to create a protectorate in the Ngazidja island (Grande Comore). In the same year, other protectorates were established in Mwali (Mohéli Island in French) and Ndzwani (Anjouan)

Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore (1897)In 1908, the three islands were united under one administration referred to as Colonie de Mayotte et dépendances and were placed under the governorship of the French colonial governor general of Madagascar. In 1909, Said Muhamed, the Sultan of Anjouan, relinquished his seat in favor of French leadership. The colony and the protectorates were eradicated in 1912 and the islands converted to a province of the Madagascar colony.

From 16th June 1940 up to 1942, the colonial governorship was loyal to Vichy France under the French, but from 25th September 1942 to 13th October 1946, Comoros, just like Madagascar was under British rule.

Sovereignty came at a slow pace to the country. Towards the middle of the 20th century, France began to slowly agree to the appeals for constitutional modifications. As a result, Comoros became an individually governed colony from Madagascar in 1946.

The country became a French overseas colony after World War II and the islands had representation in the National Assembly of France. The islands were granted internal political independence in 1961 and in 1973, a treaty was reached with France for the Comoros to attain independence in 1978. A resolution was, however, passed by the parliament in Comoros on 6th July 1975, that declared unilateral autonomy.

Two referendums were held in December 1974 and February 1976 and the people of Mayotte voted against sovereignty from France both times. Mayotte, therefore, remained and is still under French rule. The government of Comoros now has control over Anjouan, Mohéli, and Grande Comore only.

The Comoros Independence
The first president of the islands was Ahmed Abdallah who was ousted in an armed coup and replaced by Prince Said Mohamed Jaffar, a member of the United National Front of the Comoros on 3 August 1975. Jaffar was also ousted in January 1976 by Ali Soilih, his Minister of Defense. President Soilih governed all the islands in the Comoros except Mayotte which had voted against sovereignty. During his short tenure, Soilih put in place a few isolationist and socialist policies that put a strain on the relations with France. This led to him being overthrown on 13 May 1978 by Bob Denard who reinstated Adballah who had the support of the South African, Rhodesian, and French governments.

A number of factors marked Abdallah’s tenure; heightened adherence to Islam, renaming of the country to the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, and authoritarian rule. During his presidency, Bob Denard was a de facto ruler of the nation and the commander of the Presidential Guard (PG). The white regimes in Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) and South Africa, trained, funded and supported him, and in return, Denard was to allow them to build a secret listening station in the country.

Between 1985 and 1987, the relationship between the locals and the PG grew worse. Towards the end of the 1980s, South Africans were no longer in support of the mercenary government. France was also in agreement and Abdallah wished for the mercenaries to leave. The PG responded by conducting a coup that resulted in the death of President Abdallah. In 1989, Denard and his mercenaries were forced by the French and South African governments to leave the islands.

After President Abdallah’s death, Said Mohamed Djohar became the next president. His tenure was faced with a lot of turbulence, for instance, an impeachment attempt in 1991, and a coup attempt in 1992.

Through a coup, Bob Denard and his mercenaries took over the islands on September 28, 1995. France denounced the coup and its president, Jacques Chirac, gave an order for his special forces to recapture the country. Denard responded by creating a new presidential guard and setting up h2 posts armed with heavy machine guns across the islands, especially around the country’s two airports. 600 men were deployed by France on October 3, 1995, to fight the mercenaries and Denard’s force. Denard, however, instructed his team not to fight back and a few hours later, the French Embassy in Moroni and the airports at Hahaya and Iconi had been secured. Denard and his cronies surrendered the following day. Caambi El-Yachourtu took over governance as the acting president until January 1996 when Djohar came back from exile. Presidential elections were held in March 1996 and Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim was elected as president.  

In 1997, Mohéli and Anjouan islands announced their sovereignty from the Comoros so as to restore French rule. France, however, declined this request, resulting in bloody fights between the rebels and the federal forces. In April 1999, the Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Azali Assoumani, took over leadership in a bloodless coup which ousted the Interim President Massounde. Azali was not able to re-establish control in the islands and unify power. The African Union, through Thabo Mbeki, President of South Africa, enforced sanctions on Anjouan to assists in effecting reconciliation and brokering negotiations. The country’s name was changed to the Union of Comoros, a new structure of political sovereignty was put in place for each island, and a union government for all the islands established.

In 2002, Azali resigned as president so as to vie in the democratic presidential elections which he won and he led the country through changes in the constitution that permitted new elections. In 2005, a Loi des compétences law was enacted; it outlined the duties of governmental organ and it is going through the implementation process. In 2006, Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi won the elections. The elections of 2010 were won by Ikililou Dhoinine and on 26 May 2011, he was inaugurated as the president.
