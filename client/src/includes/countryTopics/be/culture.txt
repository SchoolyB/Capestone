Belgian culture is a potent combination of world-renowned art, gastronomical delights (chocolates and beer), baroque architecture and iconic literature. Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck (who gave rise to the term Flemish art) painted masterpieces here and Herge created his lovable, legendary comic character Tintin. Poet and playwright Maurice Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1911.

Mostly, cultural life finds expression within each of the major communities because there are no bilingual universities, except the royal military academy, no common media, and no common large cultural or scientific organization where both are represented.

Folk festivals play a major role in the country's cultural life. The Carnival of Binche and Aalst, the Ducasse of Ath, the procession of the Holy Blood in Bruges, the August 15 festival in Li√®ge, and the Walloon festival in Namur attract hordes of people and are vivid, joyous affairs.

Football and cycling are popular sports and among the famous cyclists, Eddy Merckx has won five Tours de France and is considered one of the best cyclists ever. The Spa-Francorchamps motor-racing circuit is also considered one of the most challenging in the world and is home to the Belgian Grand Prix (a Formula One World Championship race).
