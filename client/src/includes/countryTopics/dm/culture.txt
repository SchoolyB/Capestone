Inhabited and occupied by different nations, the country of Dominica has a lot of cultural influences from the Africans, French and English. Aside from them, the country was originally inhabited by the tribes of Arawaks and Kalinago Carib people. With a mixture of these people’s cultures, it can be concluded that Dominica indeed offers a diverse and rich culture.

Celebrating in the form of festivals is very much a part of the Dominican culture. Music, dance, and cooking are always present whenever there are parties and festivals celebrated by its people. The annual World Creole Music Festival has been observed by the country for many years now. It is part of the country’s celebration of its independence as a nation from the Great Britain.

Ecotourism is one of the keys to Dominica’s developing economy. People visiting the country enjoy doing lots of recreational activities such as hiking, trekking, swimming, mountain climbing, fishing, and other sports involving the waters and the mountains. The country can also be a shopping destination as its people are fond of making handicrafts which is one of their featured products. They also have artifacts in their shopping centres.

For a country with lots of influences and inhabitants, having its people speak a lot of languages cannot be helped. English is the country’s official language, though a whole lot of its people (80% of the population) speak Creole language which is also spoken by other French islands surrounding it.

Dominicans are mostly Christians with 80% of them being Roman Catholics.
