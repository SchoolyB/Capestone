The people of Dominica have many cultural influences and this fact results to them having different religions. Though this is the case, Christianity still remains as the country’s major religion practiced by a large majority in the country.

Christians comprise almost 75% of the country’s population of approximately 70,000 Dominicans. Of these Christians, roughly 60% are Roman Catholics. Christianity is the major religion in the country since its invaders and conquerors have been practicing Christianity ever since. Moreover, people practicing other religions only comprise a small fraction of the country’s population.

Aside from Christianity, Dominican people joined Evangelical churches (18% of the country’s population) and practice different religions like Seventh Day Adventist, Baptist, Pentecostal, Church of God and others. Of all the Evangelical churches, the Seventh Day Adventist has the most number of religious practitioners, comprising 6% of the country’s population.

The government of Dominica does not involve itself and interfere with the people’s religions, though they have always maintained close ties with the Christian church. Christian holy days like the Good Friday and Christmas are national holidays in the country, proving the government’s respect and bond with the Christian church. On the other hand, the government also gives importance to the Evangelical churches proven by another national holiday celebrated annually which they called the National Repentance and Dedication Day. The members of the Evangelical church believe that there should be a day of prayer for everyone to wish their country well.

Public schools teach Christian education as part of their curriculum. Every day, students do a morning Christian prayer where non-Christians are not forced to join.
