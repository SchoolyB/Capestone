Tourism and agriculture are the two main parts of the backbone of Dominica’s economy. The country is very rich with picturesque natural destinations which are assets to the country as tourist hot spots. On the other hand, the country’s agricultural products also bring growth and development to the Dominican economy.

For years now, Dominica has been relying on its banana export as their main source of income for the country. Agriculture has 1/3 of the country’s workforce and this can be exhibited by the abundance in agricultural products produced by the country for import and export. Aside from banana, they also export their other products such as cocoa, citrus fruits (which are very much abundant), coconuts, spices and essential oils. They are also into the industries like food processing, soap manufacturing, and producing cigars and essential oils.

Tourism is very much a key to the country’s economic success. Known as the “Nature Island of the Caribbean”, Dominica offers a whole country full of beautiful natural sites which are considered one of the best tourist attractions. Seemingly untouched, the country is mostly covered by mountains and rich rainforests which serve as home to the country’s wonderful sites such as waterfalls, lakes, springs and rivers. Opening these amazing wonders of nature to the tourists bring lots of income to the natives.

The country’s trade partners are the United Kingdom, United States of America, and other European and CARICOM countries. As part of the CARICOM (Caribbean Community), it is also a member of the Caricom Single Market and Economy.
