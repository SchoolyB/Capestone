The current appointed Governor General of Barbados is Sir Clifford Husbands.

The Lower House members of this bicameral body, or more commonly known as the House of Assembly, are the elected members. 30 members of the House of Assembly are elected every 5 years. It is not the person that is elected but a political party and a winning party selects a member to represent them in the House of Assembly. All political parties may field in 30 candidates and the one with the most seats won can put their political party leader in the office of the Prime Minister.
