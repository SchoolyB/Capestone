Majority of the population of Bermuda practices Christianity. The Anglican Church remains the strongest with 23% (in 1970 it was 45%), followed by the Roman Catholic Church at 15%, then African Methodist Episcopal at 11%, and Seventh Day Adventist at 7%. Other religious denominations in the country include Methodist, Baptist, Christian Science, Jehovaâ€™s Witnesses, Buddhism, Judaism, Scottish and Canadian Presbyterianism.

In the last decades, there has been a significant shift in the Bermudians faith from old guard religious sects to the more charismatic evangelical churches. Church congregations in Bermuda are also quite active especially in communities. Because of this, church leaders have strong influences and roles in the Bermudian culture. There are plenty of churches tourists can see and visit while roaming around the islands. One can check the Saturday newspaper for church services available in the country.
