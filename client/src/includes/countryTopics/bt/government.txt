The Legislative Branch consists of the National Assembly with 150 members, 100 of whom are representatives of the public, and 50 are monastic representatives nominated to the government by the National Monastic Body in the capital city of Thimphu.

The Judicial Branch is composed of the highest-level court or the Supreme Court of Appeal headed by the King himself, which hears appeals of decisions from the High Court and informal petitions from the citizens; the High Court of six justices, including the Chief Justice, with two elected by the National Assembly, and four appointed by the Druk Gyalpo for 5-year terms; the District Court in each district headed by a magistrate; and the Village Head who adjudicates minor civil disputes among the village residents.

These zones or regions are divided into 20 districts or dzongkhag, with a government work force similarly working under the authority of the Royal Civil Service.
