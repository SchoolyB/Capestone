The Constitution of Bhutan provides for freedom of religion but prohibits religious conversions. The country has adopted Mahayana Buddhism as its official and state religion which is practiced by more than 70% of its population. As a state religion, it is supported financially by the government through annual subsidies that also extend to Buddhist monasteries, shrines, and monks and nuns. During the reign of Jigme Dorji Wangchuk, the government supported the manufacture of 10,000 gilded or gold-plated bronze images of the Buddha, publication of calligraphic editions of Kanjur, a collection of the teachings of the Buddha, and Tenjur, a collection of commentaries, and the construction of numerous chorten or Buddhist shrines throughout the kingdom.

Brought into the country in the 8th century, Buddhism continues to play a fundamental role in the sociological, cultural and ethical development of Bhutan and its population. The central figure of the faith is the monk who is held in high esteem as he plays an active part in the life of communities through religious ceremonies.

Minority religions also exist in the country. They include Hinduism and Islam. Hinduism is practiced by about 25% of the population mostly of Nepalese origin in the southern part of the country. It is also supported by the King who has decreed some major Hindu festivals as national holidays. Islam has about 5% of the population as its adherents but is not allowed to proselytize in line with the Bhutanese law. A small number of Christians and Bon or animistic worship priests are also present in some parts of the country but their activities hardly influence the life of the people.
