Freedom of religion and conscience is provided in Fijiâ€™s 1970 Constitution, creating an environment of peace and harmony among the religions existing in the country, led by Christianity. A 2007 census has ranked Christianity, which came into the country when it was ceded to the British in 1874, as having the most number of adherents at 64.5%, followed by Hinduism at 27.9%, Islam at 6.3%, Sikhism, 0.3%, and other religious groups including the non-believers at 1.0%. The denominations of Christianity include the Methodists, 34.6%, Roman Catholics, 9.1%, Assemblies of God, 4%, Seventh-Day Adventists, 2.9%, and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, 2.2%.

Hinduism is one of the first Asian religions to enter the country with the introduction of Indian contract laborers brought by the British. Islam was brought to the country also by the British in late 19th century. The current Islamic community in Fiji is composed of people of Indian origin, most of whom are Sunni Muslims, while its associations include the Mannatal Islam Association of Fiji and the Fiji Muslim League. The early Muslims had their leaders who were literate and well-versed in Islam.

Sikhism advocates salvation of man through personal and disciplined meditation of the message of the Almighty. It came to the country through Sikhs who acted as free migrants, teachers, policemen and religious preachers but, generally referred to as Punjabis, they established themselves as farmers. A 2007 census says the Sikhs number 2577 in the country or .86% of the Fiji Indian population. They regard Bai Gyan Singh Sangha, the first Sikh priest in the country, as one of the famous Sikhs who have influenced the life of many.
