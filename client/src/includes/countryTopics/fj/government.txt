The government of the Fiji Islands is under a military junta created by the countryâ€™s continuing political instability. In normal times it is a parliamentary representative democratic republic run through the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches, and a local government system of city and town councils under the Ministry of Local Government and Urban Development.

The Executive Branch consists of a President, who is head of state elected for a 5-year term by the Great Council of Chiefs after consultation with the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the President, and a Cabinet of 25 Ministers appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

The Legislative Branch is the Parliament composed of the 71-member House of Representatives elected for 5-year terms, and the 32-member Senate appointed by the President on the nomination by the Great Council of Chiefs. The Senate does not initiate any legislation but may amend or reject it on majority vote. An Attorney-General, who is a Cabinet member, is allowed to participate in the sessions of both houses of the Parliament.

The Judicial Branch which is independent of the Executive and Legislative branches consists of the High Court and Supreme Court which are both presided by the Chief Justice, the Court of Appeals, and Magistrates Courts. The Court of Appeals is headed by a president and hears and determines appeals from the judgments of the High Court but whose decisions are appealable to the Supreme Court whose decision is final. In the local government administration, the cities of Suva and Lautoka have their own councils as the town councils, which are composed each of a mayor and elected councilors.
