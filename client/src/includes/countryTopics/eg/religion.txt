Religion was an integral part of ancient Egyptian civilization and not much has changed in this respect. Even today, religion permeates many aspects of social life in Egypt and is endorsed by the law.

Egypt is predominantly Muslim, with Muslims composing 90% of the population. Almost all of Egypt's Muslims are Sunnis. Most of the remaining 10% are Christians, many of whom belong to the native Egyptian Coptic Orthodox Church.

According to a December 2006 judgment of the Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt, there are only three recognized religions: Islam, Christianity and Judaism. This has led to the stigmatization of and discrimination against minority communities such as Bahais or atheists and agnostics. The government denies the granting of civil documents to Bahais, including ID cards, birth certificates, and marriage licenses, without which they find it difficult to register their children in school, open bank accounts, or start businesses. Police also regularly detain those without correct documentation and thus some Bahais frequently stay home to avoid possible arrest.
