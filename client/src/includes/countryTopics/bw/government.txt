A parliamentary republic, Botswana is run by a presidential representative who is state, chief executive, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The president is elected by a simple majority of the National Assembly and he appoints a cabinet from among the National Assembly members, including the vice president, who also serves as a cabinet minister. Executive power is exercised by the government.

Legislative power rests with the government and a bicameral Parliament, which consists of the House of Chiefs (a largely advisory 15-member body) and the National Assembly (63 seats). Since independence, the party system has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party.

The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and consists of the High Court; the Court of Appeal; and Magistrates' Courts (one in each district).
