The Republic of Botswana has many superlatives to its credit. Despite protecting some of Africaâ€™s deepest forests and driest deserts, it is one of the most stable countries in Africa. It is also the continent's longest continuous multi-party democracy and the world's largest producer of diamonds.

Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. The capital of Botswana is Gaborone, a fast-growing modern city with good facilities.

This land-locked nation in South Africa is covered by the Kalahari Desert on 70% of its land but it remains a peaceful nation with one of the fastest growth rates in per capita income in the world. The biggest problem affecting Botswana today is HIV, which it is trying to battle with one of Africa's most-advanced treatment programs.
