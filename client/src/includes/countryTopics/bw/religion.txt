A majority of people in Botswana are Christians with 71.6% of the population following Christianity. About 6% practice Badimo, literally "Gods" in Tswana, which is the indigenous African traditional religion. Although the official figures are low, Badimo traditions spill over into the lives of even those who do not practice it officially. About 20% of the people do not follow any religion.
