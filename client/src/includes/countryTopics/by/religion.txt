The major religion of Belarus is Christianity, with 80% of the people practicing the Eastern Orthodox faith. Orthodox Christianity came to the country as far back as 990 AD from Greece.

Roman Catholic and Protestant Christians make up the other 20% of the population along with Jews and Muslims.

During the seven-decade Soviet rule, people were mainly atheistic but there has been a steady re-emergence of religion in the country.
