Belarus’s rich and complex history has led to a unique and distinct culture that is neither wholly Polish, nor Russian. Theatre, language, dance and literature are developed art forms and make up an important part of the culture. Belarus has four World Heritage Sites, with two of them being shared between Belarus and its neighboring countries.

The sculptured front of a building in Minsk, SourceGovernment-sponsored annual cultural festivals such as Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk; Minsk Spring; Slavonic Theatrical Meetings; International Jazz Festival; National Harvesting Festival; Arts for Children and Youth; and the National Festival of the Belarusian Song and Poetry provide a platform for performers, musicians, poets and dancers. State holidays, like Independence Day and Victory Day also draw big crowds with their impressive parades and fireworks displays. Ice Hockey is Belarus’s most popular sport.

Belarus comes under heavy criticism and censure from human rights and media organizations for its restrictive and suppressive attitudes to freedom of speech, private assembly and the private press. President Lukashenko is on the Reporters Without Borders organization's list of "predators of press freedom" and his government has been accused of carrying out a "systematic crackdown" on the private press.
