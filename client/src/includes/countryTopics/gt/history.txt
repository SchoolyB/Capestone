The Mayan civilization was centered in Guatemala, proven from the many artifacts and sites excavated and dated as early as 3rd – 10th century A.D. or the Maya period. The largest, and probably most famous, of these is found in the northern part of the lowlands, in Tikal. In this location, temple pyramids, plazas, monuments, and more that make up a total of about 3,000 structures were discovered. An area of 6 square miles, this is believed to have been where a community of about 50,000 Mayans settled. Up to now, it remains a mystery why the entire place was abandoned sometime at the close of the 10th century.

Between the years 1523 and 1524, the Spanish forces led by Pedro de Alvarado subjugated Guatemala. Three centuries later, Guatemala was released from Spanish domination and declared its independence on September 15, 1821. About that same time, seeing this to his advantage, then Mexican ruler Agustin de Iturbide integrated Guatemala into his empire. Guatemala was free again by 1823, when a revolution crashed Iturbide’s reign and the Mexican republic was born. That same year, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica formed the United Provinces of Central America. Unfortunately, not long after, the association was formally disbanded in 1838. Several dictators took over after that period.

The election of Juan José Arévalo as president of the republic was the turning point for Guatemala. During his term, the border disputes between Guatemala and the British Honduras (or was it now known as Belize) was settled, although it proved a real struggle. In addition, Arevalo also made it a point to settle the disagreements between United Fruit Co. and its employees, and in favor of the workers. After his presidency, Guatemala made a shift to the Communist side, perpetuated by Jacobo Arbenz Guzman. Decades after this radical change, the republic constantly struggled with unjust declarations and anti-Communist demonstrations. There was a lot of chaos and turnovers of power for a good many years. These revolts officially culminated in 1993 when Congress appointed Ramiro de Leon Carpio to take control of the republic.
