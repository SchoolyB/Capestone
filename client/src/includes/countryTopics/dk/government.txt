Denmark is a constitutional monarchy, governed according to the 1953 constitution. Legislative power is vested in the monarch (who is also head of state) in conjunction with the unicameral Folketing (parliament) of 179 elected members. Executive power is exercised by the monarch through his or her ministers, led by the prime minister, who is the head of government. The cabinet of ministers is responsible to the Folketing and must have the support of the majority of that body.

The political system of Denmark is a multi-party structure, where several parties are represented in the Parliament. Danish governments are most often minority administrations, governing with the aid of one or more supporting parties. Since 1909 no single party has had the majority of parliamentary seats.

The monarchical head of state is Queen Margrethe II and Prime Minister Rasmussen, leader of the Venstre (Liberal) Party, was re-elected in February 2005.
