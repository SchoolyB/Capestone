France poses an influential role in the entire culture of Gabon. The extreme French influence in the country’s culture can be seen in the way Gabonese writers express themselves in exclusive French. A closer study of Gabon culture will provide students with an interesting pre-colonial history and traditions practiced by Gabonese. The epics have had a great impact in the country as the major tribes of Gabon specifically the Fang dominated the art and culture of the Bantu civilizations.

Newspapers in Gabon are written in French and the media, including the national and provincial radio stations use French in broadcasting. However, local languages are still prevalent and television broadcasting for instance airs programs and shows in local languages. Publications written in French are distributed immensely across the country and most of the television program are relayed in French—talk about French deeply-rooted influence.

There are 40 identified ethnic groups in Gabon and Fang comprised the largest group. Teke, Pounou, and Eshira are the other large groups. Gabon still conducts ceremonial traditions but they vary from tribe or group. Each group is distinct from one another as each has specific personality.

At present, Gabon has an approximately 1.5 million population and there are equal number of men and women. The 60% of the population lives in the city while the remaining 40% resides in the villages. Currently, many Africans from other countries go to Gabon to find work opportunities. For the record, French is the national language of Gabon and it is spoken by the majority of Gabonese under the age of fifty.

Finally, Gabon music and folklore are worth exploring if one wants to get a clear grasp of Gabon culture.
