Babinga or Pygmies are believed to be the earliest humans in the land of Gabon and their existence can be dated back to 7000 B.C. Bantu groups later on found settlements from the southern and eastern areas of Africa. Gabon is composed of tribal groups and among the largest tribe are the Fang people. They constitute 25% of the population.

The first exploration of Gabon was conducted by Portuguese navigator Diego Cam in the 15th century. Gabon’s etymology was coined in 1942 when the Portuguese explorers who encountered the mouth of the Como River named the river of Gabon as “Rio de Gabao”. In 1953, the Dutch arrived in Gabon followed by the French in 1630.

In 1839, the French successfully established their presence in the land of Gabon. They settled on the left bank of Gabon estuary. Slowly, the French conquered the hinterland and in the second half of the 19th century. In 1888, Gabon was officially identified as a French territory also known as an autonomous republic under the French Union after the World War II. In 1910, the country was one of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, a known federation that lasted until 1959. On August 17, 1960, Gabon gained its independence and became an independent republic along with the other three territories of the French Equatorial Union.

The first president of Gabon elected in 1961 was Léon M’ba and Omar Bongo Ondimba was the vice president. In 1967, M’ba died and was replaced by Bongo, who continued to become the head of state until his death in 2009. Bongo served for three consecutive seven-year terms.
