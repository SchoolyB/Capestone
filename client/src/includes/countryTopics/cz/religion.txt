Despite the diverse cultural differences in the country, Czech Republic has established its traditional religion which is Roman Catholicism. However, other Czechs refuse to enter a religion, thus, claiming themselves to be atheists. Along with Estonia, the Czech Republic has been known to have the least religion factors in the world. 2001 census says that around 59% population of the country includes agnostic, atheist, or non-believer. Roman Catholics were about 26.8% of the population; and Protestants were around 2.5% of the total population of the Czech Republic. Moreover, Czechs do not really focus on religious matters, in fact, the census also showed that the fastest growing religion between 1991 and 2001 was the non-religious by about 19.1%.

Czechs are historically considered as tolerant towards religion. Quite a number of percent falls into the non-believers. Between 1999 and 2001, one of the fastest growing religions of the country had been the non-believers and the Christianity level of believers had not even increased or had depleted. Due to the Communist rule between 1948 and 1989, majority of the Czech people had not identified themselves according to religion.

Czech Republic has freedom on religion, which is provided by the Constitution. The Government also respects this right. Other religions in Czech Republic include Czech-founded Hussite Reform Church, Czech Brotherhood Reform Church, Silesian Evangelic Church, Jewish community, and Orthodox Church. Moreover, missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses believers are also present in the country.
