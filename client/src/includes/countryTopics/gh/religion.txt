Religion is very much a part of the Ghanaian culture. Ghanaians give much regard to their respective religious beliefs and practices which is why the government set the major religious celebrations in the country as national holidays. People allot special time for religious events and rites that their group observes.

Christianity was brought by the Portuguese in the country in the 15th century. However, the Christian church and its foundations were done by the Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries who came in the country in the 19th century. This is the reason why most Christians in Ghana are part of Presbyterian and Methodist churches. The Volta region is dominated by Evangelical Presbyterians while the Roman Catholics dominate the Central and Ashanti regions. The Fante groups of the Akans are Methodists while the Akwapims are Presbyterians. A unifying organization called the Ghana Christian Council makes the different Christian churches in Ghana cohesive.

Islam is also the religion of a number of Ghanaians especially in the Northern region since the time of Ancient Ghana. Most Ghanaian muslims are Sunni except for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community which is non-Sunni.

Traditional religion also exists in the country and is practiced by most of the Ghanaians. They believe in a Supreme Being called the Nyame among the Akans and Mawu among the Ewes. Lesser Gods are also present in mountains, rivers and trees which serve as mediums between people and the Supreme Being. They also believe that their departed ancestors are their direct link to the world of the Spirits.
