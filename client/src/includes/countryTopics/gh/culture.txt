The Ghanaian culture is rich and diverse in nature as there are a lot of ethnic groups present in the country. Aside from that, there are many other foreign settlers which inhabited and invaded the country during its early times. There are 6 main ethnic groups in the country namely: Akan (Ashanti and Fanti tribes), Ewe, Ga-Adangbe, Mole-Dagbani, Guan, and Gurma. Each group has their own characteristics, practices and beliefs as well as language but the unifying Ghanaian culture still remains.

Ghanaians are very fond of festivities and celebrations and they have different rites and rituals for every occasion they celebrate. Being religious people, Ghanaians observe every religious function that their religion has. Ghanaian festivities are very much a part of their culture, and some even have historic meanings and significance. The Homowo Festival, which literally means “making fun of hunger”, is a celebration of the Ghanaians in commemoration of a great famine in the Accra plains. It was said that harvest arrived and there came plentiful food after a deadly famine, and the Homowo festival celebrates the event.

Panafest is a festival in the country which celebrates the Ghanaian heritage. It is a celebration of the Ghanaian origins and is done every summer. There are many other festivities in the country, some even about child birth, marriage, or death. These celebrations make people happy and satisfy the community.

Ethnic communities are very much dominant in Ghana. The Ghanaian chiefs are given high authority and are able to marry dozens of women as this determines their high status in the society. Polygyny is allowed in the country, and women are to remarry their husband’s brother in case their husband dies.
