ahrain formally known as the Kingdom of Bahrain is a small Arab kingdom located in the Persian Gulf. The country is made up of a group of islands between the Qatar peninsula and the north eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is an island country located near the western shores of the Persian Gulf in the Middle East. Bahrain's history dates all the way back to ancient history. Bahrain was the main city of the old Dilmun civilization and its strategic position in the Persian Gulf brought about rule and influence from the Arabs, Persians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Sumerians, and the British. Read on below to know more on the country's history.

Antiquity in Bahrain
Bahrain Fort, Manama, Bahr√©in SourceDuring the Bronze Age era, Bahrain became home to the Dilmun civilization. This made the country an important trade centre that linked Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. The Assyrians and Babylonians later ruled Bahrain.

From the 6th to the 3rd century BC, Bahrain was a section of the Persian Empire governed by the Achaemenian dynasty from Iran. Two other dynasties controlled Bahrain from the 3rd century BC to the 7th century BC when Islam arrived in the country. These were the Parthians and the Sassanids. By around 250 BC the Parthians brought the Persian Gulf under their control and expanded their influence to as far as Oman. They also developed garrisons along the Persian Gulf's southern coast so as to control the trade routes.

During the classical era, the ancient Greeks referred to Bahrain as Tylos, the hub of pearl trading, when Nearchus, the Greek admiral, made his first visit there. Nearchus served under Alexander the Great who ousted Al Hamar, the ruling tribe. Alexander's plan was to settle Greek colonists in the country but it is not clear whether that happened on the scale he had imagined. Bahrain, however, became a section of the Hellenised world; Greek was the language of the upper classes but Aramic was still spoken in everyday use, and Zeus was venerated in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the location of Greek athletic competitions.

Middle Ages in Bahrain
In 899 AD, Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili Muslim faction conquered Bahrain in an attempt to establish a utopian community founded on reason and re-distribution of property among the people. The Qarmatians, later on, started demanding tribute from the Baghdad Caliph, and in 930 AD sacked Medina and Mecca, and brought the sacred Black Stone to Ahsa, their base in Bahrain for Ransom.

In 976 AD, the Qarmatians were defeated by the Abbasids and overthrown by the Arab Uyunid dynasty of al-Hasa. The dynasty controlled the whole of Bahrain from 1076 until 1235 when the region was temporarily inhabited by the Persian ruler of Fars. The Uyunid dynasty was brought down in 1253 by the Bedouin Usfurids who gained control over eastern Arabia, as well as the islands of Bahrain. The archipelago was turned into a tributary nation of the rulers of Hormuz in 1330, but the islands were locally governed by the Shi'ite Jarwanid dynasty of Qatif. The Jabrids, a Bedouin dynasty also located in Al-Ahsa took control of the archipelago and most of eastern Arabia in the mid-15th century.

Early modern era in Bahrain

The Portuguese rule lasted for about 80 years, and they relied a lot on the Sunni Persian rulers. In 1602, Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty of Persia expelled the Portuguese from the islands, and this gave momentum to Shia Islam. The Persian rulers retained power over the region for the next two centuries, with brief invasions from the Ibadhis of Oman in 1717 and 1738. During most of this time, the Persian rulers governed Bahrain indirectly, either through migrant Sunni Arab clans or through the city of Bushehr. The Sunni Arab clans were tribes that were coming back to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf regions in the north and they were referred to as Huwala. The Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur marched into Bahrain in 1753 on behalf of Karim Khan Zand and reinstated direct Iranian rule.

In 1783, Nasr Al-Madhkur lost the Bahrain islands after he was defeated by the Bani Utbah tribe at the Battle of Zubarah in 1782.

19th century and later in Bahrain
The Omanis and the Al Sauds both invaded Bahrain in the early 19th century. In 1802, Bahrain was ruled by a 12-year-old child, Salim, who was appointed by his father Sayyid Sultan as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, William Bruce, the British political residence in the Gulf, got a letter from Bahrain's Sheikh who was worried about a rumor that Britain would support an attack on Bahrain by the Imam of Muscat. The Sheikh was reassured that that was not the case and both parties came up with an informal agreement that assured the Sheikh or Britain's neutrality.

In 1820, Great Britain recognized the Al Khalifa as the rulers of Bahrain after signing a  treaty leadership.

In 1860, after writing letters to the Ottomans and the Persians, Al Khalifas placed Bahrain under Ottoman's protection who had offered better conditions for the country. The government of British India eventually subdued Bahrain after the Persians declined to protect it. A new treaty placing Bahrain under British protection and rule was, therefore, signed by the Al Khalifas and Colonel Pely.

After the Qatari-Bahraini War in 1868, British delegates and the Al Khalifas signed another agreement stating that the ruler could not give away any of his regions to anyone except the United Kingdom and had to seek for consent from the British so as to engage in relationships with foreign governments. The British in return promised to protect Bahrain from any sea confrontations and to give support when attacked on land. In 1880 and 1892 other agreements were signed sealing the protectorate status of Bahrain to the British. It was in 1892 when Britain formally established its authority in the territory.

During its tenure, Britain was able to place Bahrain under the de facto rule of Charles Belgrave. He acted as the ruler's advisor until 1957. Belgrave brought about a number of reforms, for instance, the founding of Bahrain's first modern school in 1919, the first girls' school in the Persian Gulf in 1928, and the obliteration of slavery in 1937.

Classic Car in Bahrain National Museum, SourceOil was discovered in the country in 1931 by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, an auxiliary of the Standard Oil Company of California. Production commenced the following year and this brought quick modernization to the country. In the early 1930s, the Bahrain Airport was constructed. In the same decade, the Bahrain Maritime Airport was also constructed for seaplanes and flying-boats.

Bahrain took part in the World War II on the Allied side. After the end of the war, there was an increase in anti-British sentiments that spread throughout the Arab world leading to mutinies in Bahrain. The mutinies mostly concentrated on the Jewish population and in 1948 when the hostilities increased, most of the Jews were forced to evacuate to Bombay and later on settled in Israel and the United Kingdom.

In the 1950s, the reformists formed the National Union Committee after the sectarian clashes and demanded for an assembly that had been elected and the dismissal of Belgrave.

On 15 August 1971, via a referendum held by the United Nations, Bahrain declared its independence despite the Shah of Iran claiming historical autonomy over the country. The United Kingdom and Bahrain signed a new treaty of friendship and in the same year, Bahrain became a member of the United Nations and the Arab League.

After the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Bahraini Shi'a fundamentalists organized a failed coup attempt in 1981 under the patronage of the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain.

Between 1994 and 2004 a popular uprising took place and Islamists, liberals and leftists all joined forces. The uprising came to an end after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa was appointed Emir of Bahrain in 1999. He released political prisoners, set up elections for parliament, and gave women the right to vote. A referendum between 14 and 25 February 2001 h2ly supported the National Action Charter and as part of its adoption, Bahrain changed its official name from the State (dawla) of Bahrain to the Kingdom of Bahrain on 14 February 2002.

Following the Arab Uprising in 2011, protests also began in Bahrain on 14 February and they were mostly directed at gaining respect for human rights and more political freedom. The protests were very peaceful until a pre-dawn raid by the police on 17th February to disperse protestors from the Pearl Roundabout in Manama, where four protestors were killed by the police. This made some of the protestors increase their aims and they called for the end of the monarchy. On 15 March King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa decreed a 3-month state of emergency and instructed the military to strengthen its authority since the clashes were spreading across the country. As of March 2014, over 80 civilians and 13 policemen were killed as a result of the uprising.
