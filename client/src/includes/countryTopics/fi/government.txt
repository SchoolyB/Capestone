A Republic with a representative democracy, Finland is governed by the principles of parliamentarism. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Finland while executive affairs are decided by the Council of State, led by the prime minister.

The President formally appoints and dissolves the Government and he or she also suggests a candidate for Prime Minister, after negotiating with the parties in Parliament and consulting the Speaker of Parliament. The functions of ministers are extensive. They prepare the national budget and legislative reforms and after obtaining the approval of Parliament and the President, implement the latter.
