The main religion of Finland is the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, of which about 82% of the people are members. A minority belongs to the Finnish Orthodox Church. Other Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church in Finland are significantly smaller, as are the Muslim, Jewish and other non-Christian communities.

The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches are the official churches of Finland but most of the population holds generally secular views. Many Finnish people do not actively practice religion.
