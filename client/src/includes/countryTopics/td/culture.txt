The government of Chad has established the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Center apparently to promote and preserve Chadian culture and traditions. Much of its cultures can be traced to pre-colonial times when the leadership of indigenous states changed hands among competing sultanates. These cultures have affected the ways of living of many Chadians.

As in the olden times, there is still social stratification among the people. The wealthy and the influential are identifiable from the poor by symbols such as dress style, leisure activities and location and style of their residence. Chadian businessmen or landowners have their own class as are the common peasants and pastoralists. In urban centers are members of the vocal working class.

In architecture, building styles and spaces differ from one region to the other, but the traditional house and hut building style is still found in the country sides where the construction of corrugated iron and concrete buildings has begun to expand. Also in the country sides, especially in the sparsely populated north, houses are built away from pasture lands while several nomads live in shelter structures and tents. In the town of Abeche, which is characteristic of Chadian architecture, clay buildings and monuments can be found.

Men and women have their own gender roles in society. While men dominate the government, the military, the public and political life, women handle family responsibilities and household tasks that include child care, among others.
