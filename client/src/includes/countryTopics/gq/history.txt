The pygmies, or small people, were the first known inhabitants of Equatorial Guinea before Bioko Island was discovered by Portuguese explorer Fernando Po in 1671. The island was named after him and, together with Annobon, was colonized three years later. They remained under Portuguese control until they were ceded to Spain in 1778. In 1885, Rio Muni in the mainland became a protectorate and then as a colony of Spain in 1900, when the Treaty of Paris settled the conflicting claims to the mainland.

Following numerous events including World War I when German troops retreated to the territory for reasons of Spain being neutral, and a rebellion at Bata and the rest of the country, an election was held in September 1968. Francisco Macias Nguema was elected as the first President. Two years later Spain granted independence to the country to give way to pressures from the United Nations. In 1972, Macias took complete control of the government, assuming the title of President for Life, but his administration was characterized by a reign of terror, resulting to the death or exile of about one-third of the country’s population. Beginning 1975, schools and churches were ordered closed, as the economy began to show signs of falling into ruins. In 1976, about 60,000 Nigerian contract workers left Bioko Island en masse almost simultaneously with the departure foreigners and skilled citizens.

In August 1979, Macias’ nephew Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who was director of the infamous Black Beach Prison, led a successful coup d’etat, leading to the arrest, trial and execution of Macias, and to his assumption of the Presidency in October 1979. Unsuccessful coup attempts were launched in 1990 to 2004 to replace Obiang with a puppet ruler supported by Western governments and international corporations. Since 1999, legislative elections have been held in the country but reports have it that these elections were marked by fraud and intimidation and alleged torture of political opponents of the President.
