Revised in 1994, the 1967 constitution of the country of Bolivia provides for balanced executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The traditionally strong executive, however, tends to overshadow the Congress, whose role is generally limited to deliberating legislation initiated by the executive. Consisting of a Supreme Court, the judiciary is an independent Constitutional Court and departmental and lower courts that has long been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitutions in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system.

The Government Palace in La Paz, Bolivia, where the executive branch sits, SourceVictor Paz Estenssoro stepped down as president of Bolivia in 1989 and on August 6 he handed over power to the third democratically elected leader of the 1980s. Paz Estenssoro presided over four years of economic and political stability following two decades of military rule and nearly six years of a tumultuous transition to democracy.

Bolivians chose their departmental prefects (similar to governors) by popular vote on December 18, 2005 for the first time in history. The country’s nine departments received greater autonomy under the administrative decentralization law of 1995, although several departments—especially Santa Cruz and Tarija—are seeking increased autonomy. In a July 2006 referendum, Bolivia’s four eastern departments voted in favor of increasing regional autonomy, and the other five provinces opposed the measure. The autonomy movement rallied around Sucre’s August 2007 demand that the constituent assembly consider moving all branches of government to the traditional capital. Civic committees in six departments (Santa Cruz, Tarija, Beni, Pando, Cochabamba, and Chuquisaca) supported hunger strikes and protests in Sucre, which led to Bolivian Government-sponsored talks between Sucre and La Paz leaders, which were inconclusive as of March 2008.
