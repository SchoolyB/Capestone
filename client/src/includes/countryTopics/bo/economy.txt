Bolivia is one of the poorest nations in Latin America despite the importance of its tin silver, and other mines and its large reserves of natural gas and crude oil. A large part of population makes its living from the illegal growing of coca, the source of cocaine; a government eradication program begun in the late 1990s has depressed the economy in those areas where coca-growing was important. Soybeans, coffee, cotton, corn, sugarcane, rice, and potatoes are the other major crops; timber is also important. Industry is limited to mining and smelting, petroleum refining, food processing, and small-scale manufacturing. The tin industry has received increasing competition from SE Asia, and as a result several tin mines have closed. Although Bolivia has much hydroelectric potential, it is underutilized.

Boliviaâ€™s 2002 gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $9 billion. Economic growth is about 2.5% a year and inflation expected to be between 3% and 4% in 2002.

The Government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating poverty since 1985. The capitalization of numerous public sector enterprises is the most important structural changes in the Bolivian economy. Three units of the Bolivian state oil corporation (YPFB) involved in hydrocarbon exploration, production, and transportation were capitalized, facilitating the construction of a gas pipeline to Brazil in 1996. The government has a long term sales agreement to sell 30 million cubic meters a day of natural gas to Brazil through 2019.
