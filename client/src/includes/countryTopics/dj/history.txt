Arabian immigrants came to the country in 3 B.C. and from them descended the Afars who are today’s Djibouti natives. The Somali Issas followed thereafter. After over 800 years, Islam was introduced to the country and it became the first country to adopt Islam in the African continent.

In 1843, French troops arrived in the country and signed a treaty with the Somali sultans, which makes the land their territory. The French gained interest in invading the land because of its strategic location – the capital city’s port serves as a port open to other ships crossing the Red Sea. Then, the administrative capital of the country was Obock.

In 1884, France expanded its territory to the Somaliland and Gulf of Tadjourah which is affirmed by its agreement with Ethiopia. A few years later, the capital city was changed from Obock to Djibouti which has ready access to the Ethiopian highlands. Its natural harbour also attracted traders from East Africa which made the country open to other travellers.

Then called French Somaliland, it joined the French community as their overseas territory, which entitled them representation in the French Parliament and French Union Assembly. However, French President Charles de Gaulle’s visit in the country in August 1966 was bombarded by numerous public demonstrations demanding their independence. Governor General Louis Saget decided to hold a referendum to know if the people would like to remain under the French control or become independent. The following year, almost 60% agreed to stay under the French control. Later that year, its name was changed to French Territory of Afars and Issas.

Due to insistent public demand, the French government finally considered granting independence to the country. In June 27, 1977, the Republic of Djibouti was established with Hassan Gouled Aptidon as its first President.
