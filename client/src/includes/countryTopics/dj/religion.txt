Arabs are the first settlers in the country dating back in 3 B.C. and in 825 B.C. the religion of Islam was introduced. The French occupation of the country in the 1800s up to the late 1900s introduced Christianity to the country, but Islam still remained the religion practiced by the majority of the Djibouti people.

Of the 740,000 people in Djibouti, 94% practice Islam. The Somali Issas (60% of the population) and the Afars (35% of the population) are Muslims. Only 6% of the population practice Christianity. A little over 9,000 people are Roman Catholics and they are under 1 diocese. Other Christian churches include the Protestants, the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian (religion practiced by the Ethiopians in the country). Bahaâ€™i Faith is also practiced by a small minority. However dominant, Islam is not the state religion and there are no constraints as to what religion each person should practice. Each religion is respectful of the other.

Religious festivals are very much observed in the country. Islam and Christian festivals are celebrated as national holidays in the country. Some of these festivals include the Eid Al Adha and Eid Al Fitr for the Muslims, and Christmas and New Year for the Christians. During these religious festivals, especially for the Muslims, people wear traditional clothing as a sign of sincerely celebrating the festivity.

When it comes to the deceased, all bodies are buried, whatever religion he/she practices. There is no cremation in Djibouti. The Afars and Issas believe, however, that the souls of their dead rejoin their ancestors.
