The Djiboutian culture is a mixture of the Arabian, French, Italian, and Ethiopian cultures. As people from different cultures enter its land, Djibouti adapts to others’ culture, mixing them with their own, and coming up with a diverse culture which is uniquely Djiboutian. Major influences come from the Arabs and French as they were the ones who occupied the country for long periods.

Djibouti’s population of over 740,000 people includes Somalis (60%) and Afars (35%) which are the natives of the land. A little percentage (5%) of the population is of the French, Arabs, Ethiopians, and Italians. However, French and Arab are the official languages of the country while Somali and Afar are native languages. Still, Somali is the most widely spoken language in the country as French are restricted to those who can afford education.

The people of Djibouti celebrate religious and national festivities with much happiness. Their Independence Day (June 27) is perhaps the most important of all national holidays as they value independence very much. Eid Al Adha and Eid Al Fitr are major Islamic festivals celebrated in the country and are observed as national holidays as well. For the Christians, Christmas is also celebrated every 25th day of December, and New Year every January 1.

Due to the climate in the country where crops cannot be grown, people in Djibouti earn for a living by working in the civil service industry, port services, or corporate business organizations. Women, on the other hand, are more on the household chores and child rearing.
