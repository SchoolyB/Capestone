Freedom of religion is provided under the Constitution of the Central African Republic. Suspended in 2003 as a result of political unrest in the country, the Constitution was replaced by a new one approved in a nationwide referendum in 2004, retaining many old provisions, including those that govern the right to practice any religion, except the practice of any form of religious fundamentalism, especially those practiced allegedly by Muslim fundamentalists. Religious groups are also required to be registered with the Ministry of Interior but are banned to practice witchcraft, which is a criminal offense.

Christianity leads in the number of adherents, accounting for 50% of the countryâ€™s population, which is shared equally by its denominations Roman Catholics and Protestants as 25% each. Indigenous beliefs account for 35% and Islam for 15% of the people living primarily in the north. Missionary groups existing in the country include the Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists and Grace Brethren, which are Christian denominations, mostly coming from the United States, France, Italy, Spain, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and other African nations.

The Roman Catholic Church in the country is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church under the spiritual leadership of the Pope. In the country, it has the Archdiocese of Bangui and eight dioceses of Alindao, Bambari, Bangassou, Bossangoa, Berberati, Bonar, Kaya-Bandoro and Mbaiki.

With 15% of the population, Islam is the second most organized religion, most of whose adherents live in the north and near the border with Chad, a predominantly Muslim country.
