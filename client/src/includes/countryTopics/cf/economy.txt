Subsistence agriculture and forestry form the backbone of the current economy of Central African Republic. As of 2006, agriculture accounts for 56% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 74% of the population. Earnings from agriculture come from cultivation and sale of food crops including cassava, peanuts, millet, sorghum, maize, sesame, plantains, and the exports of such cash crops as cotton, coffee, and tobacco. Export earnings from timber, which account for 16% boost the revenues generated by the diamond industry which accounts for nearly 54% of the earnings of the export sector. The countryâ€™s export market includes Japan, 40.4%, Belgium, 9.8%, and China, 8.2%.

The per capita income of US$300 per year (US$700 per year as of 2008) is one of the lowest in the world but is based on recorded sales of exports and excludes the incomes generated under the so-called informal economy, such as the proceeds of unregistered sale of foods and locally produced items such as alcohol, ivory, diamonds, bush meat and traditional medicines. Moreover, many women are able to make such alcoholic drinks from food crops as hard liquor and sorghum beer, and derive considerable income from the sale of these items and the sale of food crops.

Inadequate modes of transportation and communication networks and poverty pose as major problems of economic development. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are trying to help the country to rise from these problems by encouraging its government to implement the much-needed economic reforms and clearly state its most important priorities that must include poverty-alleviation measures.
