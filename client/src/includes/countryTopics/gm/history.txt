Gambia has a rich history attributed to the Gambia River home to many civilizations. The many different tribes were believed to have established their settlements along the riverbank. Later on this body of water became the centre of European trade with priced objects of barter. As a matter of fact, it has even witnessed the slave trade.

Written accounts about ancestral Gambia are rare. The only recorded history about ancient Gambia was authored by Hannon the Carthaginian on his West African expedition journal. Oral history was but preserved through the Griots who has been considered as the memory keepers of native beliefs, customs, and traditions. In turn, these wisemen are responsible to pass on their knowledge to the young generations.

As early as 9th century, Arab traders came into the territory which also introduced Islamic faith that led to the conversion of chieftains and the rest of the tribe members. Later in 1500, many Europeans became interested in the Gambian territory due to the trading advantage. Western traders include Portuguese, English, Latvians, and French. Common subjects of trade are ivory, gold, spices, mirror, etc. In the 17th century though, trade slave has outstood the rest of the commodities.

Among the westerners though, Great Britain in 1783 by virtue of the Treaty of Paris was given the authority to acquire the territory including control of the Gambia River. Getting the approval of tribe leaders was easy since existing tribal strife led them to seek protection to British authorities. One great accomplishment of this ruling empire came in 1807 when slave trade was abolished. Success of the abolition was made possible through the efforts of the British Navy that patrolled along the river. Finally, a century thereafter on February 18, 1965 the British Empire granted independence to Gambia.
