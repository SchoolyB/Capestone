Gambia is an Islamic nation attributed to the religious influence brought by the Berber traders even before the 10th century. Although Muslims dominate the populace, Christian religions are also practiced in the country with minimal followers. All these religious groups peacefully co-exist with no apparent social division.

Islam particularly Sunni is the major religion in the country with more than 90% of believers from the entire populace. Muslim dominance is not surprising though, the faith has been introduced in the country way before other religious missionaries came into the land. As early as 7th century, there were already Muslims in North Africa particularly the converted Berbers who brought the religion to West Africa in the 14th century.

Christianity is one of the minor religions in the nation representing the 9% share of the populace. The Christian Faith has been initially introduced by the Portuguese in the 15th century. Gambian Christianity though, crystallized only in the 19th century. In particular, most of Christian believers are Roman Catholics comprising 2% of the overall population share. Other Christian believers include Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Protestants, Seventh Day Adventists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Gambian government is open to the religious diversity. In fact, it even promotes harmonious affiliation with the Muslims and Christians. The former administration would even invite religious leaders from both religions during New Year’s Day celebration to give their greetings to the President. Similarly, both religious leaders are asked to lead the prayer in major State affairs. This is further extended in the society where no religious barrier is observed hence the typical intermarriage of Muslims with Christians.
