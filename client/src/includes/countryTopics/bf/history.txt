Burkina Faso is situated in West Africa and it is a landlocked country. The nation is a neighbor to six countries; Ivory Coast to the southwest, Benin to the southeast, Ghana and Togo to the south, Niger to the east, and Mali to the north. The country was initially referred to as the Republic of Upper Volta and was renamed ‘Burkina Faso’ by Thomas Sankara, on 4th August 1984.

The country’s history is made up of the history of a number of kingdoms, for instance, the Mossi Kingdoms, French colonization of the region, and its sovereignty in 1960 as the Republic of Upper Volta.

Ancient and medieval history
Dwarf Mask, late 19th century, SourceFrom 14,000 BC to 5,000 BC, the northwest region of modern-day Burkina Faso was inhabited by hunter-gatherers and their tools such as arrowheads, chisels, and scrapers were found in 1973via archaeological digs. Agricultural villages were then formed between 3600 and 2600 BC.

The Iron-Age Civilization era was experienced from the 3rd to the 13th centuries AD via the Bura culture. This culture was found in the present-day southeast region of Burkina Faso and southwest Niger. This era was characterized by smelting and forging of weapons and tools.

Between the 8th and the 15th century, a number of ethnic groups of modern-day Burkina Faso, for instance, Dyula, Fula, and Mossi started arriving in the country. From the 11th century, The Mossi community created a number of separate kingdoms and they ruled the territory up to the end of the 19th century. These were an empire-building people and were believed to have originated from the northern region of Ghana, where the ethnically-linked Dagomba community still dwell. During this period, the Mossi kingdoms safeguarded their territory, social structure, and religious beliefs successfully against any attempts at conversion and conquest by their Muslim neighbors towards the northwest.

At the onset of the 1890s, a series of German, French and British military officers tried to conquer some regions of present-day Burkina Faso. Most of the times these colonial powers and their armies would fight the locals, and at times they would come up with treaties and forge alliances with them. The colonial governments and their officers also came up with treaties amongst themselves and as a result, Burkina Faso became a French colony in 1896 after an intricate succession of events.

In 1897, the western and eastern regions were occupied by the French, and by 1898, most territories of Burkina Faso had been conquered.

It is the Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898 that established the nation’s present borders. Conflict between the colonial powers and the locals progressed for close to five years and in 1904, most of the regions of the Volta basin were assimilated into the French West Africa’s colony of Upper Senegal and Niger and the colonial capital was at Bamako.

Recruits from the region took part in World War I in the Senegalese Rifles battalions and between 1915 and1916, the cities in the western region and the eastern border on Mali became the stage of the Volta-Bani War, the most significant armed opposition against the colonial government. The movement was suppressed by the French government and on 1 March 1919, the French Upper Volta was established. France also separated modern-day Burkina Faso from Niger and Upper Senegal. Haute Volta was the name given to the new colony. The colony was governed by Charles Alexis Édouard who started promoted growing cotton for export and initiated a program to make the infrastructure better. The colony was, however, broken up on 5 September 1932 and was split amongst the French colonies of Niger, French Sudan and Ivory Coast. After the end of World War II, this change was reversed by the French who revived the Upper Volta Colony on 4th September 1947 with its former borders as a section of the French Union. On 11th December 1958, Upper Volta was turned into an autonomous republic in the Franco-African Community, and it attained complete sovereignty in 1960.

Republic of Upper Volta
As mentioned earlier, the Republic of Volta was formed on 11 December 1958 as a self-autonomous colony in the French Community. The name Upper Volta was linked to the country’s position along the upper reaches of River Volta. The river had three tributaries: the Black, White and Red Volta which were represented in the three colors of the country’s earlier national flag. Maurice Yaméogo, leader of the Voltaic Democratic Union (UDV) became the first president of Burkina Faso. The constitution of 1960 allowed for widespread voting of a national assembly and a president for five-year terms. When Maurice came to power, he banned all other political parties. His government was very corrupt and favored French economic and political interests’ thus allowing politicians to enrich themselves and not the country’s urban workers or peasants. His government was in power until 1966 when the military intervened and ousted him after mass strikes and demonstrations from civil servants, students and labor unions.

The capital, Ouagadougou, in 1930The coup leaders of the 1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état disbanded the National Assembly, suspended the constitution and appointed Colonel Sangoulé Lamizana as the president of a government made up of senior army officers. The army was in power for 4 years and on June 14, 1970, a new constitution was ratified and it created a four-year change period towards a total civilian rule. Lamizana stayed in power throughout the 1970s as the president of mixed civil-military or military governments. In 1977 a new constitution was written and approved and in 1978 Lamizana was re-elected by open elections. He was, however, overthrown on November 25, 1980 by Colonel Saye Zerbo via a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo formed the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the highest governmental power, decimating the constitution of 1977.

On November 7, 1982, Colonel Zerbo was overthrown by Major Dr Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo and the Council of Power Salvation (CSP). Political parties and organizations were still banned by CSP, though it promised a new constitution and a change to civilian governance. Fights developed between the left and the right blocs of CSP. In January 1983, Captain Thoman Sankara, leader of the leftists was appointed Prime Minister but was arrested immediately after. Captain Blaise Compaoré tried to free him thus leading to a military coup on 4 August 1983. The coup helped to bring Sankara to power.

Burkina Faso
Under President Sankara’s directive, the nation’s name was altered from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso. His government established the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), and Sankara was the council’s president. He also founded common Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) and the Pioneers of the Revolution youth programme. He also set in motion a socioeconomic programme for change. Most of his foreign policies were founded on anti-imperialism, he pushed for the reduction of debt, nationalization of land and mineral affluence, rejection of foreign aid, and reduction of the influence and power of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Some of his domestic policies included re-distribution of land to peasants, countrywide literacy campaign, construction of roads and the railway, and abolishment of polygamy, forced marriages and female genital mutilation. He also pushed for public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against measles, yellow fever, and meningitis.

Sankara was assassinated on October 15, 1987 via a coup and Captain Blaise Compaoré rose to power. Compaoré, Major Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lengani and Captain Henri Zongo created the Popular Front (FP) to continue and follow up on the aims of the revolution. On September 18, 1989, Lengani and Zongo were accused of scheming to oust the Popular Front, and the two were executed that very night. Compaoré re-arranged the government, nominated a number of ministers, and he himself took up the position of Minister of Defense and Security.

On June 2, 1991, a new constitution was adopted and it established the forth republic. The constitution called for an Assembly of People’s Deputies with a total of 107 seats (presently 111). The constitution identified the president as the chief of state, he appoints a prime minister who serves as the head of government, with a consent from the legislature. The president was also the chair of the council of members. The constitution was amended in April 2000 and it reduced the presidential term from seven to five years. This was to be enforced in 2005. The amendment allowed the president to be re-elected only once.

President Compaoré was elected for the third term in April 2005 and again in November 2010 for a fourth term. In June 2014, his party, CDP, called on Compaoré to engineer a referendum that would enable him to change the constitution so as to seek reelection in the 2015 elections. This move led to what was known as “Burkina Faso’s black spring” and Compaoré had to shelve the constitutional changes that had been proposed. On October 31, 2014, he declared that he had resigned as president, and he called for free and transparent elections in 90 days. Yacouba Isaac Zida took over power as head of state in an ad hoc capacity. On 17 November 2014, Michel Kafando, a civilian, was elected to replace Zida as the interim head of state. He was sworn in on the 18th of November and on 19th he nominated Zida as the Prime Minister of Burkina Faso.

The country experienced a failed coup d'état in September 2015 after the National Reconciliation and Reforms Commission recommended the disbandment of the Regiment of Presidential Security (RSP). President Kafondo and Prime Minister Zida were detained by members of the RSP, who put in place the National Council for Democracy in power with its chairman being Gilbert Diendéré. The members were asked to surrender their arms and they were promised that no harm would face them if they surrendered in a peaceful manner.

It is believed that Kafando was under house arrest until 21 September, when he was said to have arrived at the home of the French ambassador. He was reinstated as the president of Burkina Faso on 23 September 2015 in the presence of all ECOWAS leaders.
