The Croatian constitution guarantees freedom of religion and also states that all religious denominations are equal in the eyes of the law and separate from the state. Most Croats believe that they are religious. Based on the census of 2001, almost 88% percent of the populations are Roman Catholics while more than 4% are Orthodox Christians, Muslims account for more than 1%, there are only 0.3% Protestants in the country but non-believers or agnostic composed more than 5% of the population. According to a 2005 Eurostat poll, 67% of the population believes that “there is a God”.

In cooperation with the religious communities who have agreements with the state, religious teachings are allowed in public schools but attendance is not compulsory. Public elementary and secondary schools have organized religious classes usually coordinated by the Roman Catholic Church.

Religious festivals are also public holidays which includes St. Stephen’s or Boxing Day, All Saints’ Day, Christmas, Epiphany, Assumption Day, Easter Monday and Corpus Christi Day. Though these holidays are based on the Catholic Liturgical year, believers of other religions are allowed legally to celebrate other religious holidays.

As long as the religious communities are in agreement with the state the marriages they conduct are officially recognized hence there is no need to register in the civil registry.

A concordat or agreement between the government and Vatican established that the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia will received state financial support and other benefits. Other non-Roman Catholic religious communities have also similar agreements with the government. Public schools catechisms and military chaplains are also covered and regulated by these agreements.
