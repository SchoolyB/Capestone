Most of its beautiful national parks are located along the Adriatic coast. This is also the birth place of historical figures and scientists like the Josip Broz Tito, first president of the second Yugoslav Republic or Giovanni Luppis, the inventor of the torpedo.

In clothing or fashion, it is believed that the necktie or kravata in Croat originated here. The first churches built here were influenced by Roman arts especially in the region of Dalmatia where the Roman cities where built. Croatian food is known as the cuisine of regions for the simple reason that every region has its own distinct cuisine. These foods include Raznjici which is a kind of skewer, Meso s tiblice which is pork ham, Odojak which is roast pork and goulash a kind of stew.
