Burundi has an interesting mix of religious groups originating from East and West of the globe. Undoubtedly, this is attributed to the freedom of religion promoted by the State hence the continuous arrival of religious missionaries. However, religious beliefs have not substantially altered ethnic customs and traditions.

By virtue of the 2005 Constitution, the State declares religious freedom hence every citizen is free to practice his choice of faith. Intended to this end, the government has also implemented rules for the regulation of the religious sector. Recognition of religious affiliation and registration of places of worship are mandatory. Failure to comply would merit sanction such as closure of the establishment and imprisonment of responsible authorities.

In line with the promotion of free faith, the State promotes no particular religion. National government respects all recognized religious groups hence the due recognition given to Catholic and Islamic sacred days. In turn, neutral religious status of the government resulted into peaceful co-existence of several religious congregations.

In particular, majority religious groups which account for 67% of the populace are comprised of Christian congregations. These are the Roman Catholics with 62% share, and the Protestants and Anglicans with an accumulated share of 5%. Minority religious groups sharing 33% of the populace are composed of traditional and Eastern beliefs. These are varied ethnic religions with 23% share and Islam with 10% share. Other religions with budding network of memberships include the Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses and the Seventh Day Adventists which are affiliated to Christianity, as well.
