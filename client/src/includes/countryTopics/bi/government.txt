Burundi assumes democratic and republican form of government. In consequence, there are three co-equal branches of the government such as executive, legislative, and judiciary. All these elements are necessary to provide for the check and balance within the system in running the State. Officials to assume office are either elected or appointed.

Executive power is vested to the president who is both the head of the government and the State. Elected into office by 2/3 of the legislature, the President holds the office for five-year tenure effective since 2005. Also, he runs the executive body along with his appointed Vice President of the Parliament and Ministers of the Cabinet.

Legislative power is granted to the legislature characterized by a bilateral house. Burundi Parliament is particularly composed of the Senate and the National Assembly whose members are to serve for five-year term. The former consists of 54 Senators of which 34 are elected by indirect votes and 20 are ethnic group leaders and state chiefs while the latter consists of 100 congressmen of which 60% are Hutus and 40% are Tutsis. Legislative functions are directed towards bill proposition and law enactment.

Judicial power is conferred to the Supreme Court comprised of nine members inclusive of the President. The Highest court system is further subdivided into three chambers known as administrative chamber, chamber of cassation, and judicial chamber. Burundi Constitutional Courts likewise comprise another high court entity in the land. Other courts include the Court of Appeals and the Tribunals of the First Instance.
