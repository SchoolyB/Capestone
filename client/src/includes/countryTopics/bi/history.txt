Burundi has a rich historical origin based on its ethnic settlers. These same ethnic tribes though, have arrested national growth and development in almost all facets of the society. No wonder, until the present national rehabilitation and reform programs are instituted to advance the dire condition prevalent across the country.

Original settlement in the Burundian territory is attributed to the Twa tribe. In the 11th century though, the Hutu tribe came into the scene and dominated the land in terms of number. The Tutsi tribe came in the 14th century which contrary to the Hutu dominated the land in terms of influence. In turn, this tribe remained in power for centuries thereafter.

Burundian Kingdom has been instituted by the Tutsi as early as 16th century along the eastern foothills. It was only in the Rugamba reign (1796 to 1850) though, that the monarchy gained ultimate political influence by doubling in scope. Particularly, the King was considered as the “Mwani” owning vast lands and cattle. Patron-client relationship characterized governmental system in which the subjects pay tributary tax in exchange for royal protection.

Mid-1800’s, European explorers and Christian missionaries came into the land. Germans officially commenced rule in 1899 when Burundi befell into the German East Africa colonies. It was also believed that the epidemic outbreak infecting people and animals in the area was brought about by the same foreign conquerors. Although the Germans came into power first, the Kingdom ended up being shared by Belgians and British rulers in 1923.

Independence was finally granted on July 1, 1962. Colonial rule may have ended but civil war has just started. Since then, the tension between Hutu and Tutsi tribes has never been pacified which resulted in many deaths on both parties. In 2007, even the United Nations peacekeeping operations have put to end its efforts to appease these factions to concentrate on economic development, instead.
