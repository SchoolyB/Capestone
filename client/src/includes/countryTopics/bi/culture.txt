Burundi has a diverse culture characterized by prevalent ethnic divisions. Basically, there are three ethnic groups sharing the territory such as Hutu (89%), Tutsi (10%), and Twa (1%). Interplay of ethnic differences though is dominant between Hutu and Tutsi that oftentimes lead to tribal strife.

In particular, the Hutu arrived first in 11th century and dominated the populace. It is the Tutsi though which came later in 14th century that has taken power in the political scene. In fact, members of the tribe are divided into four royal clans such Bambutsu, Bataga, Batare, and Bezi corresponding to the four major dynasties in Burundian history.

The same way, the Tutsi has remained to rule the social elite attributed to their ascendance in wealth. Privilege in land and cattle ownership is likely vested on them. This can be ascribed to the cattle clientage system which dates back in the 14th century. In turn, the Hutu is left to do the labour either by farming the land or by herding the cattle.

Cattle are not only regarded as the prime possessions of the locals. This sort of animal is also symbolic in Burundian spiritual realm deserving of prayer and worship. In general, cattle stand for happiness, health, and prosperity. Even in casual greetings, these are considered as part of giving tribute to others. “Amashyo” which is a traditional greet is translated as more herds of cattle to come.

Aside from cattle, lands are also believed to possess spiritual power. Land fertility ceremony is celebrated to ask “Kiranga” (god of ancestral spirits) for a good harvest. Ceremonies like this are commemorated by playing the drum which is renowned as a spiritual symbol, too. As a matter of fact, according to tradition getting to play the drum of the King means a big fortune for young boys.
