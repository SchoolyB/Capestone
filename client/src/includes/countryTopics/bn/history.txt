Early accounts on Brunei history can be traced back in the 6th Century when they were reportedly doing trade with China.  Islam allegedly arrived in Brunei in the 12th century based on some relics found.  Hindu influence came through allegiance to the Javanese Majapahit Kingdom between the 13th and 15th century.  During the decline of the Majapahit Kingdom, there was widespread conversion into Islam which Brunei succumbed into and eventually became an independent sultanate in the 15th century.  From the 16th to the 19th century, Brunei became a powerful state ruling over the northern part of Borneo up to the nearby islands.  Brunei started to lose control over the territory when they lost Sarawak in 1841 and eventually becoming a British protectorate in 1881 and in 1905, they were dependent on the British.  During World War II, Brunei had fallen under Japanese regime, along with neighbouring states until 1945 when they were liberated by Australia.

The sultanate slowly got back into power and in 1959, regained the controls over its internal affairs.  Britain retained the responsibility for the stateâ€™s defense program and foreign affairs policies until 1984.  After which, the sultanate of Brunei became fully independent.

Sultan Bolkiah began his reign at age 22 in 1967 when his father, Sir Omar Ali Saifuddien, abdicated the throne.  The sultanate became wealthy during his reign mainly because the Brunei had cultivated the rich Seria oilfield.   Up to now, Brunei is one of the wealthiest nations in Asia with a very high per capita income.  The sultan is considered one of the richest men in the world.  Sultan Bolkiah inaugurated his heir to the 500-year-old monarchy, the Oxford-educated Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, in August 1998.
