The country is composed mainly of Islamic influences, but, the culture is still predominantly Malay.  With regards to conservatism, Brunei is ahead of Malaysia.

Brunei is very particular in the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Brunei takes pride as a Shariah country, therefore, public consumption and the sale of alcohol is strictly banned.  However, non-Muslims citizens and also foreigners are allowed to bring in at most twelve cans of beers and two bottles of other alcoholic drinks such as wine or spirits.  For every entry, that limit was applied, but, it was later changed to one limit for every 48 hours back in 2007.  Eventually, all nightclubs and pubs were closed after the introduction of prohibition in the early 1990s.

The citizens of Brunei are largely under the rule of their Sultan who heads the government and stands as their religious leader as well.  Because the economy of the country is in good standing, the literacy is very high.  Compared to other Islamic societies like in the Middle East, women in Brunei have a much higher status.  Women have been allowed to hold positions of responsibility in the government even in the armed forces, and serving combat is optional for them.  Their traditional head covering called the tudong is encouraged to be worn by the women. Marriages in Brunei are usually arranged by the parents of the young man to the parents of the young girl.  Muslim parents still prefer Muslims for their child thatâ€™s why a lot of conversion to Islam happens, especially by men, before marriages.
