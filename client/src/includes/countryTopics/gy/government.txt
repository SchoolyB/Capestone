The Cooperative Republic of Guyana, formerly British Guiana, is divided into 10 administrative regions namely: Barima-Waini, Cuyumi-Mazarumi, Demerara-Mahaica, East Berbice-Corentyne, Essequibo Islands-West Demerara, Mahaica-Berbice, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Upper Demerara-Berbice, and Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo. Its capital is Georgetown.

The government of Guyana is divided into 3 branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The Chief of State is the President and the Head of the Government is the Prime Minister. Under them is the Cabinet of Ministers which is appointed by the President. The people of Guyana vote for their President as a leader of a party list in parliamentary elections and is elected through popular vote. The elected President shall appoint the Prime Ministers and the members of his Cabinet of Ministers and shall serve for a 5-year term. They have no term limits. Each member of the Cabinet of Ministers is assigned to a particular ministry of the government in charge of the different sectors such as health, education, transportation and communication and others.

The legislative branch of the government is responsible for making the laws. The Guyanese legislative branch is a Unicameral National Assembly composed of 65 seats. The 65 representatives occupying the seats are chosen by popular vote by the people. They serve for a 5-year term just like the President. There are not more than 4 people who are non-elected non-voting ministers, and 2 people who are non-elected non-voting parliamentary secretaries to be given seats in the assembly as well.

The judiciary branch of the government has the Supreme Court of Judicature as its highest body, with the High Court and Court of Appeals under it. However, they have the right to file a final appeal to the Caribbean Court of Justice, with Guyana being a member of the Caribbean Community.
