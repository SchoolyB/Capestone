Small clay lamps are filled with oil and are lighted, signifying the triumph of good over evil in an individual. It is customary for people to wear their newest clothes and share food with each other. Businessmen and others concerned with their finances tend to open new accounts to wish for good luck.

To be more specific, it is celebrated at the end of the winter season on the last full moon day of the lunar month. People celebrate it by throwing coloured powder and water at each other. This feast lasts for 16 days.
